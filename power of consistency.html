<h1 class="post-title">Power of consistency</h1>
<div class="post-content">
    <p>It’s safe to say that just about everyone would like to grow and
         make positive life changes this year. Many of us have these great goals 
         in mind, but for whatever reason we lose sight of them. Maybe you’ve been wanting
          to lose weight, or start your own business, or learn the guitar, and you start off 
          strong working towards your goal, but then the excitement fades. What might 
        be keeping you from reaching your full potential? It’s probably a lack of consistency.</p>
<p>The power of consistency is profound and underrated. Once you’re able to learn how and be comfortable with changing your behavior, anything is possible. Doing the little things repeatedly
     will help you accomplish those big life goals you’ve always been wanting to achieve.
     Consistency is a must if you’re looking for success in all areas of life. Here’s why:</p>
     <p> <strong>Consistency allows you to measure success:</strong>Until you’ve had the chance 
         to try something consistently over a period of time, you won’t know if it works or not.
          If you’re wanting to learn to play the guitar, you won’t know if you’re the 
          next Jimi Hendrix unless you practice consistently, every day, for a consistent amount 
          of time. It takes time and practice to develop these skills. Consistency can help you 
          overcome any lack in natural talent and
          allow you to focus on the process instead of the end goal.</p>

<p> <strong>Consistency helps to hold you accountable:</strong> If you’re meeting your trainer
     consistently three times a week and you start to slack off, you better believe
      he or she will call you out! Being held accountable is so important when it comes 
      to accomplishing a larger goal. If you can’t follow through with the small steps, 
      one day at a time, you won’t be able to reach the finish line!</p>
<p><strong>Being consistent establishes your reputation and being inconsistent can damage it:</strong> Your family, friends and colleagues need you to be consistent. No one wants to deal with someone that regularly agrees to do something, and then backs out at the last minute. If you want to be successful, it is important that you are someone that can be depended on. 
    There will come a time when you need that from the people in your life as well.</p>
<p> <strong>Inconsistency creates insecurity:</strong>  Many talented individuals never live up to their full potential because they often start many projects and fail to finish them. It’s important to keep going, even if you fail sometimes. Being able to see all your hard work
     come to fruition is motivation for the next big goal ahead of you!</p>
<p><strong>Consistency helps to create momentum:</strong>  Remember, you achieve success by consistently doing little things that help you towards accomplishing your larger goals. These little things eventually become habit. Keep moving forward a little day by day and you’ll
     gather the momentum you need to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>Many of us tend to compare ourselves to others on a regular basis. We login to social media and see those that we look up to doing well, every day. It’s important to remember that they too have days that are less productive than others, and that’s ok. But, if you concentrate on making the small daily changes habitual, you’ll allow yourself to get closer and closer to 
    accomplishing that big achievement you’ve always had your eye on!</p>
